# Records-Flipper-Zero
These are records made by me for Flipper Zero.

Installation
---------------
- Clone/Download the files directly from the repo or download the latest release.
- Extract the files anywhere you like.

Then,

Option 1:
- Insert your micro SD card to your PC/Mac.
- Drag the files to `SD card` --> `infrared` folder.
- Eject the SD card from your computer and insert it back into your Flipper Zero.

Option 2:
- On your Android phone install the [Flipper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flipperdevices.app) mobile app.
- Connect your Flipper Zero via Bluetooth.
- Open `Flipper` app --> `Options` button --> `File Manager` button --> `ext` folder --> `infrared` folder and upload the files here.

Option 3:
- On your PC/Mac install the [qFlipper app](https://flipperzero.one/update).
- Connect your Flipper Zero via USB.
- Open `qFlipper` program --> `File manager` button --> `SD Card` button --> `infrared` folder and drag the files here.
